Implementation of challenging logic based problems

triplet.c | ->  //Find all possible triplets which adds to zero

pattern.py | -> 
for N = 5
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]
[5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Enter the value of N: 7
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
[4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
