# Logical-programming
Implementation of challenging logic based problems

triplet.c | ->  //Find all possible triplets which adds to zero

pattern.py | -> 
for N = 5
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
[3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4]
[5, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4]

Enter the value of N: 7
[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2]
[4, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
[4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2]
[4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 6]
[4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6]
[7, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6]


Streak.java | ---->   From a given matrix it will show the number of streaks of same number that are being formed either st right, st down, or diagonally down.


SparseMatrix.java | --=>  It has an efficient implementation of the sparse matrix in the form of array of linkedlist
and minimizes the use of data to as minimum as possible. OOP implementation, so you just create an call the function 
getSparseMatrix and pass the matrix in its parameter and then you would get the list form where a reference to the SparseMat
object is returned directly after resolving the problem.
Every index of the List means a row and the elements in the list are the columns where datas are present.
Here, I've strictly considered for the case where datas are either 0 or 1, it can however be modified to add any desired datas
by adding data field.
